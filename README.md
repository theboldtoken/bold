# BOLD

<img src="https://www.boldprivate.network/ann_images/btctalksplash.png">

BOLD is a fast, low-supply, private digital currency created solely and purposely with a vision to become a widely-accepted medium of exchange, but in particular, to be a safe and straight-forward store of value over time. BOLD is designed for long-term value, with a solid and dedicated team behind it.

Strong. Confidential. Anonymous.
